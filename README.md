# Test lab for Generalised Deduplication
This git implements Generalized Deduplication in python. It is able to store bases and "counts" and the compressed values.
You'll also find structs that can unpack and pack a 32-bit floating point.
Function to perform different function on the compressed data and compare it to the original. 

GDDpython is a jupyter notebook that contains the bulk of the work.
Bearing data is the original data set worked on
CompressedData is the bearing that but compressed by the GDD, for 0-32 deviation bits. It its .npz files.
helpFunctions contains function used throuout the project.

If any help is wished, feel free to contact me at
